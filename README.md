    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>A simple tool / framework for interacting with the apibay.org API.</li>
        <li>Proudly built in node.js (no, not python).</li>
        <li>Uses axios HTTP client for API calls.</li>
        <li>The so-called "pirate bay"'s main webpage is utterly blocked by ISPs (internet service providers) in the UK. However, apibay remains unblocked (even without the use of a proxy/vpn). Therefore, it remains possible to access data through the use of API calls.</li>
        <li>This data includes the following (bundled into a JSON object): name, info_hash, size, category, imdb id, etc. This identical set of data is repeated for each object in the array, except with different values for each key:value pair.</li>
        <li>Lastly, it is important to note that the sole objective of this project is to bypass ISP restrictions by accessing data without the requirement of VPN tunnelling or performing other network configurations. No illicit or unethical behaviour is by any means encouraged.</li>
    <ul>
